## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, **do not create a public issue**.

Instead, please report it privately via:

📧 **Security Contact:** `your-email@example.com`  
or  
🔒 **GitHub Private Advisory:** Use “Report a vulnerability” in the repository’s Security tab.

When reporting, please include:

- A detailed description of the issue  
- Steps to reproduce  
- Impact assessment (what could happen if exploited)  
- Suggested fix (optional but appreciated)  
- Any proof-of-concept code or screenshots

You can expect:

- A response within **72 hours**  
- A severity assessment  
- A timeline for the fix  
- A coordinated disclosure process

---

## Responsible Disclosure

We request that you:

- Allow us adequate time to investigate and patch the issue  
- Avoid publicly discussing the vulnerability before a fix is released  
- Do not exploit the vulnerability beyond what is necessary for the report

We will credit contributors who responsibly report vulnerabilities unless they prefer to remain anonymous.

## Security Practices

Extra Wallet follows these internal security guidelines:

- All changes to protected branches require code review  
- No direct pushes to `main`  
- Secrets, tokens, and credentials are never committed to the repository  
- SQLite databases used for development should **not** contain real personal or financial data  
- User data is handled securely and not logged unnecessarily  
- Dependencies are regularly scanned for vulnerabilities

---

## Encryption & Data Safety

Extra Wallet handles personal finance data. We strongly advise:

- Users protect their local database (`.sqlite`) with OS-level security  
- Developers never share sample databases with real user data  
- API keys or sensitive config values must be stored in environment variables, not in code

## Thanks

We appreciate security researchers and contributors who help keep Extra Wallet safe for everyone.

If you have questions regarding security or safe usage, feel free to contact us.
